The proposed methodology for classifying crop growth stages involves a two-step approach: feature extraction using a convolutional neural network (CNN) and subsequent clustering using k-means algorithm. The CNN model architecture comprises convolutional layers for feature extraction, followed by max-pooling layers to downsample the feature maps and retain the most salient information. The ReLU activation function introduces non-linearity, enabling the model to capture complex patterns and structures present in the images. After multiple convolutional layers, the feature maps are flattened and fed into a dense layer, which learns high-level representations of the input images. This architecture is designed to effectively capture the intricate characteristics of crop growth stages present in the images.

Once the CNN extracts features from the images(TIF), k-means clustering is applied to classify the data into distinct clusters corresponding to different crop growth stages. K-means clustering is chosen for its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness in identifying natural groupings in the feature space. Overall, this methodology leverages the hierarchical features learned by the CNN model and the clustering capability of k-means to accurately classify crop growth stages from images in an unsupervised manner.
